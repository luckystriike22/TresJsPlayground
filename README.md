# TresJsPlayground
This is my TresJS playground where I'm exploring Nuxt, TresJS, and Three.js to create some exciting demo projects.

What does this repo contain:
- A blob dancing to your microphone frequency ðŸŽº (/musicblob) 
- A game where you find all hidden capybaras. An island with hidden capybaras to bring back home. The island is procedurally generated, so every restart provides a different terrain.ðŸ”Ž (/island)
